## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview  
This project presents a **spreadsheet-based decision support system** developed for *Coastal Nest Motel*, a boutique accommodation provider. The model supports **dynamic decision-making** in pricing, capacity management, and risk mitigation during peak travel seasons.  

By integrating **stochastic modelling**, **scenario analysis**, and **simulation-based risk assessment**, the tool helps optimise room pricing and booking strategies under uncertainty ‚Äî balancing occupancy targets with profitability and customer satisfaction.

## üìà Key Features  

### Model Design  
- **Fixed Inputs**: Room capacity, housekeeping costs, base cancellation fees.  
- **Stochastic Inputs**: Online bookings, cancellations, walk-ins, variable expenses.  
- **Decision Variables**: Room pricing, overbooking thresholds, refund policies.  
- **Outputs**: Daily revenue, operating costs, occupancy status, net profit.  

### Scenario Analysis  
- Best-case, worst-case, and most-likely booking scenarios.  
- Sensitivity analysis of pricing, overbooking limits, and cancellation fees.  
- Identification of profit-driving variables and operational tipping points.  

### Stochastic Modelling  
- Probability distributions (Poisson, Normal, Uniform) based on historical data.  
- Captured variability in customer behaviour and expenses.  
- Realistic demand forecasts for high-volume periods.  

### Risk Analysis via Simulation  
- Monte Carlo simulations to assess profit volatility and occupancy risk.  
- Quantified the impact of overbooking, under-utilisation, and cancellations.  
- Visual profit distribution under different risk scenarios.

## üíº Business Value & Application  
This decision model addresses real-world challenges faced by **small-scale accommodation operators**, especially during high-demand periods when overbooking, cancellations, and walk-ins create uncertainty.  

It can be adapted for:  
- Short-term rentals (e.g., Airbnb)  
- Boutique hotels and motels  
- Hospitality revenue management teams
