# accommodation-booking-optimisation-model
A spreadsheet-based decision model for optimising room pricing, occupancy, and risk management in a boutique motel using simulation, scenario analysis, and stochastic modelling.

Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive spreadsheet-based decision support system developed for Coastal Nest Motel, a boutique accommodation provider. The model is designed to support dynamic decision-making in pricing, capacity management, and risk mitigation during peak travel seasons.

By integrating stochastic modelling, scenario analysis, and simulation-based risk assessment, the tool empowers the motel’s management to optimise room pricing and booking strategies under uncertainty—balancing occupancy targets with profitability and customer satisfaction.

Business Value and Application

The model addresses real-world challenges faced by small-scale accommodation operators, particularly in high-demand periods when overbooking, cancellations, and walk-in guests create uncertainty and risk.
Key business applications include:
- Revenue and cost forecasting
- Risk-aware pricing strategy
- Operational scenario planning
- Booking and overbooking policy evaluation

This type of decision model can be adapted for:
- Short-term rental businesses (e.g., Airbnb)
- Boutique hotels and motels
- Hospitality revenue management teams

Key Features

Model Design
- Fixed Inputs: Room capacity, housekeeping costs, base cancellation fees
- Stochastic Inputs: Online bookings, cancellations, walk-ins, variable expenses
- Decision Variables: Room pricing, overbooking thresholds, refund policies
- Calculated Outputs: Daily revenue, operating costs, occupancy status, net profit

Scenario Analysis
- Explores best-case, worst-case, and most likely booking scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis of pricing, overbooking limits, and cancellation fees
- Identifies profit-driving variables and operational tipping points

Stochastic Modelling
- Used probability distributions (e.g., Poisson, Normal, Uniform) based on descriptive statistics
- Captured variability in customer behaviour and expenses
- Created realistic demand forecasts for high-volume days

Risk Analysis via Simulation
- Monte Carlo simulations to assess profit volatility and occupancy risk
- Quantified impact of overbooking compensation, under-utilisation, and last-minute cancellations
- Provided visual distribution of profit outcomes under uncertainty

Deliverables
- Booking_Risk_Model.xlsx: Contains the full decision model, simulation setup, and scenario summaries
- Motel_Decision_Model_Report.pptx: A self-contained visual report including assumptions, analysis, outputs, and business recommendations

Tools & Techniques
- Excel Solver and formula-based modelling
- Random number generation and distribution fitting
- Monte Carlo simulation for risk quantification
- Scenario-based sensitivity analysis
- Data visualisation using Excel charts and tables

Highlights
- Built a custom, scalable model tailored to the hospitality industry
-Simulated real-world operational decisions under uncertainty
- Enabled data-informed trade-offs between occupancy and profitability
- Produced clear visual reports for stakeholder communication
